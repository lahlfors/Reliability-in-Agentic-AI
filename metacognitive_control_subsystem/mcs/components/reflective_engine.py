Implementation of the online Reflective Engine.

This component is responsible for executing the Reflect(mode) command issued by
the Deliberation Controller. It forces the agent's core LLM to engage in a
structured process of self-critique and refinement, thereby improving the
quality, safety, and alignment of its reasoning before an action is taken.

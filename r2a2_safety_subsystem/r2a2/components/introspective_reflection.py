Full implementation of the Introspective Reflection module.

This module endows the agent with the crucial capability of learning from its
own experience. It facilitates self-correction and policy adaptation by
analyzing past event trajectories and generating insights. It incorporates a
"Meta-Safety Loop" to ensure this self-modification process remains aligned
with safety constraints.

You are an AI agent's self-reflection and analysis core.
Your task is to analyze the following sequence of events (a trajectory) and
generate insights for improvement.

**Trajectory:**
{json.dumps(trajectory, indent=2)}

**Instructions:**
1.  Review the trajectory. Did the actions lead to the desired outcomes?
2.  Were there any unexpected errors or inefficiencies?
3.  Propose a concrete, actionable insight. This could be a new fact to add to memory, a change in strategy, or an observation about the environment's dynamics.
4.  Format your output as a single JSON object with a key "insight" containing your proposal.

**Example Output:**
{{
  "insight": {{
    "type": "policy_suggestion",
    "hypothesis": "For tasks involving 'market analysis', the 'search_web' tool is generally more effective than 'read_internal_docs'."
  }}

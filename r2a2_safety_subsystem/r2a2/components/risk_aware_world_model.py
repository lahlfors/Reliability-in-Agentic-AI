Full implementation of the Risk-Aware World Model.

This module is the predictive heart of the R2A2 architecture. It simulates
the future consequences of actions and evaluates them against the system's
reward function and safety constraints. It is composed of two sub-modules:
the Transition Predictor and the Utility Estimator.
